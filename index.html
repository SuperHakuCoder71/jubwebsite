                          2. THE CONTRACT
                          The contract shall be subject to the following conditions which the
                          Customer shall be taken to have accepted unless otherwise agreed in writing.
                          <br><br>
                          No contract shall exist until the Company has received from the Customer an
                          order and has agreed in writing to accept it, unless the Company otherwise
                          agrees. Where the Customer's order is not in writing, the Company's
                          acceptance shall be deemed to be correct in all respects unless; within seven
                          days of its date the Customer notifies the Company in writing in what respect
                          it is incorrect.

                          binding nor shall it have any contractual effect unless it is incorporated into
                          the Company's acceptance of order.
                          <br><br>
                          The contract shall be subject to and construed in accordance with the English
                          Law.

                          the practice within the banking industry of authorizing electronic transactions
                          done with a debit card or credit card and holding this balance as unavailable

                          <br><br>
                          The company may replace certain items when not available with a like for like

                          items have been offloaded at the point of delivery or, if the goods are collected
                          by or on behalf of the Customer from the Company's premises, at the
                          moment when all the items forming a load have been loaded on the vehicle or
                          any other container.
                          <br><br>

                          The Company shall not be liable for any delay in fulfilling or any failure to
                          fulfil any obligation of the contract if any such delay or failure is caused or

                          <br><br>
                          2.4.2. If you provide false or inaccurate information to us and we suspect
                          fraud, we will record this and may share it with other people and
                          organisations. We, and other credit and insurance organisations, may also use
                          technology to detect and prevent fraud.
                          <br><br>
                          3. Protecting Information
                          <br><br>
                          We have strict security measures to protect Personal Data.
                          <br><br>
                          3.1. We work to protect the security of your information during transmission
                          by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you
                          Input.
                          <br><br>
                          3.3. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection
                          with the collection, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable customer
                          information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request
                          proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.
                          <br><br>
                          3.4. It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your
                          password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a
                          shared computer.
                          <br><br>
                          4. The Internet
                          <br><br>
                          4.1. If you communicate with us using the Internet, we may occasionally email
                          you about our services and products. When you first give us Personal Data
                          through the Website, we will normally give you the opportunity to say
                          whether you would prefer us not to contact you by email. You can also always
                          send us an email (at the address set out below) at any time if you change your
                          Mind.
                          <br><br>
                          4.2. Please remember that communications over the Internet, such as emails
                          and webmails (messages sent through a website), are not secure unless they
                          have been encrypted. Your communications may go through a number of
                          countries before they are delivered - this is the nature of the Internet. We
                          cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of Personal
                          Data that is beyond our control.
                          <br><br>
                          4.3. We may use 'cookies' to monitor how people use our site. This helps us to
                          understand how our customers and potential customers use our website so we
                          can develop and improve the design, layout and function of the sites. A cookie
                          is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive through
                          your browser, to recognise your browser and which records how you
                          have used a website. This means that when you go back to that website, it can give you
                          tailored options based on the information it has stored about your last visit on your computer.
                          However, you may not be able to use some of the products or services on our website without cookies.
                          <br><br>
                          5. Turning Off Cookies in Different Browsers
                          <br><br>
                          The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to
                          prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser
                          notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies
                          altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser
                          add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-ons settings or visiting the
                          website of its manufacturer.
                          <br><br>
                          6. Links
                          <br><br>
                          6.1. The Website may include third-party advertising and links to other
                          websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer Personal
                          Data to these advertisers or third-party websites.
                          <br><br>
                          6.2. These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising
                          companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or
                          "serve") the advertisements that appear on the Website directly to your
                          browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They
                          may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or
                          single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their
                          ads and to personalise advertising content. We do not have access to or control
                          over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices
                          of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy
                          Policy. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy
                          practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful
                          information about Internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks"
                          or "network advertisers"), including information about how to opt-out of their
                          information collection.
                          <br><br>
                          6.3. We exclude all liability for loss that you may incur when using these third
                          party websites.
